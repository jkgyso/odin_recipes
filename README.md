Chef John's 3 Best Shrimp Dinner Recipes 

1. Barbequed Shrimp
- This grill-free BBQ shrimp dish boasts big, big New Orleans-inspired flavor. _"An indigenous American shellfish dish, cooked on the stovetop,"_ says Chef John. _"It has plenty of big flavors from garlic, rosemary, and freshly cracked black pepper. Serve over hot cooked rice. Use the largest shrimp you can get."_
2. Grilled Garlic and Herb Shrimp
- Here's a classic grilled shrimp recipe that's so easy and so delicious. The marinade and the serving sauce are perked up with fresh herbs and crushed garlic. Chef John recommends the extra-large shrimp here _"so they can grill longer and get maximum caramelization."_
3. Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp Scampi
- Here's a Hawaiian-style scampi with extra garlic and a rice flour coating. Serve over rice with fresh lemon wedges. _"If you're a garlic lover, you're going to want to pull out your bucket list and add this recipe to it,"_ says Chef John. _"I absolutely love this, and I think you will too."_
