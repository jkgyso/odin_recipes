        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Here's a Hawaiian-style scampi with extra garlic and a rice flour coating. Serve over rice with fresh lemon wedges.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 head garlic</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 pound frozen large deveined, shell-on shrimp, thawed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rice flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Separate garlic cloves into a bowl; place another bowl on top. Shake until all peels separate from cloves, about 30 seconds, being careful not to shake too hard. Mince garlic cloves.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt butter in a sauté pan over medium heat; add minced garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes; transfer to a small bowl and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pat thawed shrimp dry with paper towels; add to a large mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine rice flour, paprika, salt, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl; sprinkle over shrimp and toss until completely coated using a large spoon or spatula.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp in a single layer, in batches, and cook until browned and just barely cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add some garlic butter; cook for 30 seconds more. Repeat with remaining shrimp and garlic butter. Serve immediately.
