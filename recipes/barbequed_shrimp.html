        <p>
          This indigenous American shellfish dish, cooked on the stovetop, has
          plenty of big flavors from garlic, rosemary, and freshly cracked black
          pepper. Serve over hot cooked rice. Use the largest shrimp you can
          get.

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Peel shrimp and place into a mixing bowl; set shrimp shells aside in
            a saucepan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drizzle vegetable oil over shrimp and season with black pepper,
            smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, and seafood seasoning. Mix shrimp to
            coat with spices and cover bowl with plastic wrap; refrigerate
            shrimp to absorb flavors, at least 1 hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place reserved shrimp shells in saucepan over medium-high heat with
            1 tablespoon butter; cook and stir until shells are pink and
            fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in chicken stock, bring to a boil,
            and reduce heat to low; simmer until shrimp shells have given off
            their flavor, 20 to 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strain shrimp stock through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl and add
            lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Stir to combine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place a large skillet over high heat until pan is very hot; sear
            shrimp in the very hot, dry pan until shrimp are browned, about 1
            minute per side.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir 3 tablespoons cold butter, garlic, and minced rosemary into
            shrimp; cook and stir until shrimp are opaque in the middle and
            garlic is fragrant, 1 minute. Pour in shrimp stock.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer shrimp from skillet to a bowl, using a slotted spoon;
            reserve sauce in skillet. Bring sauce to a boil and cook until
            reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Adjust seasoning to taste. Return
            shrimp to pan, reduce heat to low, and warm through, about 1 minute.
            Serve shrimp drizzled with pan sauce; garnish with a rosemary sprig.
